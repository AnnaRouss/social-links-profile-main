### what I learned
By using Flexbox more, I was able to recreate this challenge without too much of a struggle. Also learned the spacing of items better.

### Continued development

Practice definitely, makes perfect, the more I do these the better I do with the outcome of what I am supposed to create. It is also fun to challenge myself.
